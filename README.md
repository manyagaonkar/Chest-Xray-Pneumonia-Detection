# Chest-Xray-Pneumonia-Detection


Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

A deep learning project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images as Normal or Pneumonia.
The model was trained using image preprocessing, augmentation, dropout, and early stopping to ensure good generalization and avoid overfitting.
Achieved strong accuracy suitable for medical image classification tasks.

Project Overview

Implemented a custom CNN architecture from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras
Applied image normalization, data augmentation, and regularization techniques
Trained and validated the model on the Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Dataset
Demonstrated consistent performance and reliable classification between healthy and pneumonia-infected lungs
